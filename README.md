The topic of our project is analyzing whether college student-athletes are being fairly compensated compared to regular influencers. We created our own dataset by taking information from an influencer marketplace that allows companies to find influencers to promote their products. We then found information on Opendorse about student-athletes that showed how much they would charge per post. Since social media personalities with huge followings likely have a social media advisor, we focused on providing recommendations for normal student athletes with less than 50k followers. We classified individuals into 4 categories (Top-tier, Mid-tier, Micro, and Nano) by descending follower count. We took averages of the categories and compared them. We found that on average, student-athleres were underpaid by 76% compared to their regular influencer counterparts. We intend to provide these resources for other student-athletes negotiating NIL deals to know whether they are being fairly compensated.
