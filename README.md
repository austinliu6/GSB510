The topic of our project is analyzing whether college student-athletes are being fairly compensated compared to regular influencers. We created our own dataset by taking information from an influencer marketplace that allows companies to find influencers to promote their products. We then found information on Opendorse about student-athletes that showed how much they would charge per post. We classified influencers into 6 categories (Mega, Macro, Mid-tier, Micro, Nano, and Other) by descending follower count. We took averages of the categories and compared them to 6 different student-athletes with similar following. We found that of the 6 athletes chosen, 5 of them were underpaid compared to their regular influencer counterparts. We intend to provide these resources for other student-athletes negotiating NIL deals to know whether they are being fairly compensated.
